## Project Components
The Electric Pedal Generator consists of the following key components:

- **Pedal Mechanism**: A set of bicycle-style pedals attached to a sturdy frame.
- **Generator**: A motor that converts rotational energy into electrical energy.
- **Voltage Regulator**: Ensures a steady output of electricity.
- **Battery**: Stores the generated electrical energy for later use.
- **D.C.-A.C. Converter**: Converts direct current (D.C.) into alternating current (A.C.) for compatibility with standard appliances.
- **Load**: Devices powered by the generated energy, such as light bulbs and small electronics.

## Working Principle
The generator operates by converting mechanical energy (from pedaling) into electrical energy through the following steps:

1. **Pedaling**: When the user pedals, mechanical energy is generated.
2. **Kinetic to Rotational Energy**: The pedals drive a sprocket and chain set, converting kinetic energy into rotational energy.
3. **Electricity Generation**: The rotational energy powers the generator, converting it into electrical energy (D.C.).
4. **Energy Storage**: The generated electrical energy is stored in a connected battery.
5. **Conversion to A.C.**: A D.C.-A.C. converter transforms the stored D.C. into A.C. for appliance use.
6. **Powering the Load**: The generated A.C. can now power devices like light bulbs, fans, or small gadgets.

## Mathematical Model
The efficiency of the Electric Pedal Generator can be modeled mathematically. The power output \( P \) generated by the system can be described by the equation:

\[
P = \eta \cdot \frac{2 \pi N T}{60}
\]

Where:
- \( \eta \) = efficiency of the generator (as a decimal)
- \( N \) = rotational speed of the pedals in revolutions per minute (RPM)
- \( T \) = torque applied at the pedals (in Newton-meters)

The total energy generated over time \( E \) can be expressed as:

\[
E = P \cdot t
\]

Where:
- \( t \) = time in hours during which the generator is pedaled.

### Efficiency Calculation Example
For instance, if the generator operates at a torque of 5 Nm and a speed of 60 RPM with an efficiency of 85%:

\[
P = 0.85 \cdot \frac{2 \pi \cdot 60 \cdot 5}{60} = 15.9 \text{ Watts}
\]

If pedaled for 2 hours:

\[
E = 15.9 \cdot 2 = 31.8 \text{ Wh}
\]

## Applications
The Electric Pedal Generator has numerous applications, including:

- **Recreational Use**: Can be installed in gyms or homes, allowing users to generate power while exercising.
- **Emergency Power Supply**: Useful in disaster-stricken or remote areas where electricity is unavailable.
- **Educational Tool**: Demonstrates energy conversion principles in schools, teaching students about kinetic and rotational energy.
- **Portable Power**: Ideal for camping enthusiasts and hikers to charge portable devices on the go.
